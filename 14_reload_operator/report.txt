One day, while the princess was playing with her gold ball it fell into the well. Because the well was so dark, the gold ball couldn't be seen. So, the princess sat down with a thud and began to cry. Just then, the ugly frog appeared.
"Why are you crying, princess?" "My gold ball fell into your well." "I will get your gold ball, if you let me stay and live by your side?" Even though she did not like the ugly frog, she wanted her gold ball back.
With the help of the frog, the princess was able to get her ball back. "Princess, let me live with you." "Hyump! An ugly frog like you, I don't even want to see you." "But, you promised me." Still the frog kept following the princess.
When the princess was having her meal the frog ate beside her. Even when she tucked herself in bed the frog slept beside her. However, the princess disliked living with the ugly frog.
Several days later, the princess became so angry that she threw the ugly frog on the ground. However, instead of the ugly frog a handsome prince was standing before her. "My savior, would you marry me?" The most beautiful princess was able to marry the most handsome prince.
